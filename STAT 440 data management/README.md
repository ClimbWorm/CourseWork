# STAT 440 Fall 2021 Final Project Shiny App

This is the repo for the final project, which is a Shiny app. We are creating a Shiny app (for free) using all the skills acquired in this course. This project is a collaboration of our individual expression as data wranglers/engineers. The final version of our Shiny app will need to be completed (production and testing it out) and successfully working by 11:59 pm Monday December 20, 2021. This semester's app is a data management tool, in which users can work with certain existing datasets (that we must setup) or use their own data based on their user-provided data URL(s). This tool should allow for various file structures of data, delimiters, and file extensions to be imported with a URL (e.g. textbox) as well as prescribed data (e.g. dropdown menu or radial buttons) built into the app. The prescribed data can be any data covered in the course thus far. This tool should also allow for the data validating strategies (1-3) and cleaning approaches (1-4) to be executed by name and number (e.g. dropdown menu or radial buttons). This tool will be a single app.R file that all of us will have access to and be able to edit.

The app should be user friendly and look really good. It would be really nice if the app contained pictures of the cards being played and scores of the game and determine who the winners are. Ultimately, we want any person to use our app and have an awesome experience.

Each student is expected to make 1 contribution (ideas plus code plus committing and pushing those ideas/code) to the app.R file within this repo. Your contribution is worth 40 points for a maximum of 40 points. A contribution will be deemed valid by the Instructor only. Students can expect a valid contribution to be a line of code that you created or a line of code that you edited; if you write more than one line of code, that is fine, but that is not necessarily required. Spelling corrections count as one valid contribution for each student. If student X chooses to do more than one spelling correction or typo contribution on their own volition, then that is student X's choice. Your ideas and coding must be **your own code**.

**After cloning this repo, pull this repo, so that you have the latest version of the repo (and the app.R file). Work on your ideas and potential coding additions/edits locally on your computer. When you are ready to make your contribution official so that they exist in the app permanently, create a new branch with your netID and create a pull request in GitHub for this repo (you can do this by visiting the Pull Requests tab of the repo [https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/stat440-fa21/stat440-fa21-final-project/pulls](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/stat440-fa21/stat440-fa21-final-project/pulls)). Describe your contribution and the Instructor will determine if the contribution is valid, which means your contribution will be merged and officially a part of the Shiny app.**

**Do not assign a person to your pull request. Doing so negatively impacts how the Instructor can review a student's contribution. It actually prevents the Instructor from reviewing your pull request.**

**When you have questions about this final project, ask your question in the Issues board of this repo. It will be much easier to keep up with the progress of the app and your questions that way. DO NOT use the stat440-fa21-course-content repo Issues board to ask about the final project.**
